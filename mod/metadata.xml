    [b]Features[/b]
    - Select which Passive Items, Familiars, Active Items or Trinkets to start the game with
    - All selected Passives and Familiars will all be added
    - Trinkets will be added and smelted
    - only 20 of the selected Active items will load into the starting room. This is intentional to keep the room clean.
    - this mod only works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config Menu Continued[/url], it will not do anything without it.
